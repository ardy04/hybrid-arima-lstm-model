# Hybrid ARIMA-LSTM Model

My Thesis project about hybrid ARIMA-LSTM Model. The background of my research is because ARIMA is known as a good model for linear relationship time series data and LSTM is a non-linear deep learning model that can suit for any sequential Data. ARIMA will fit the linear relationship of the data, so the residual of ARIMA model will contain the non-linear relationship. That non-linear relationship will be modeled by LSTM, after modelling both model will be use to forecast the data and sum their forecast value to fit hybrid model.
